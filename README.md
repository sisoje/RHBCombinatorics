## Combinations and permutations made easy
Indexed access and iterations are calculated on the fly. There is no caching and no excess memory usage and they work in constant time.
### Iterating trough combinations
Following snippet:

        RHBCombinations(N: 4, K: 3).enumerated().forEach { print($0, $1) }
Produces following output:

```ruby
0 [0, 1, 2]
1 [0, 1, 3]
2 [0, 2, 3]
3 [1, 2, 3]
```
###Iterating trough permutations
Following snippet:

        RHBPermutations(N: 3).enumerated().forEach { print($0, $1) }
Produces following output:

```ruby
0 [0, 1, 2]
1 [0, 2, 1]
2 [1, 0, 2]
3 [1, 2, 0]
4 [2, 0, 1]
5 [2, 1, 0]
```
### Combinations by index
Following snippet:

        let combinatons = RHBCombinations(N: 4, K: 3)
        (0..<combinatons.count).forEach {
            
            print($0, combinatons[$0])
        }
Produces following output:

```ruby
0 [0, 1, 2]
1 [0, 1, 3]
2 [0, 2, 3]
3 [1, 2, 3]
```
##Example application

Example application has a "Powerball" combination generatior, it is generating combinations 5 of 69. Basically it can make your dreams come true ðŸ˜‚

## Installation
